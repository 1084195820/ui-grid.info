<div><p>There are a number of common gotchas in using the grid, this FAQ aims to cover most of them in an easy to use format.</p>

<h3 id="myfontsareallchinese">My fonts are all "chinese"</h4>

<p>Refer to <a href="#/tutorial/116_fonts_and_installation">116 Fonts and Installation</a>.  The characters are apparently Korean, 
  and in short, it means your fonts aren't installed properly.</p>

<h3 id="oneofmycolumnshasntturnedup">One of my columns hasn't turned up</h4>

<p>Your column names must be unique - have you given two columns the same name?  If you want the same <code>displayName</code> you can
  do this, and you can have two columns refer to the same <code>field</code>, but each column must have a unique name.</p>

<h3 id="howdoigetmygridtoberesponsivetakethefullpageheightautomaticallysetheightwheniusengshowthingsgobad">How do I get my grid to be responsive / take the full page height / automatically set height / when I use ng-show things go bad</h4>

<p>Refer to <a href="#/tutorial/108_hidden_grids">108 Hidden Grids</a>.  The short answer is the grid doesn't know how high it's content is until
  it renders, and it doesn't dynamically resize.  You need to give an explicit height or an explicit number of rows to render.</p></div>
