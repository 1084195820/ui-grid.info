<p>This module provides a tree view of the data that it is provided, with nodes in that
tree and leaves.  Unlike grouping, the tree is an inherent property of the data and must 
be provided with your data array.  If you are using treeView you probably should disable sorting.</p>

<p>Filtering is plausible, but requires some reworking to work with treeView - ideally the
parent nodes would be shown whenever a child node or leaf node under them matched the filter</p>

<h2 id="designinformation">Design information:</h3>

<p>The raw data that is provided must come with a $$treeLevel on any non-leaf node.  TreeView
will run a rowsProcessor to set expand buttons alongside these nodes, and will maintain the
expand/collapse state of each node.</p>

<p>In future a count of the direct children of each node could optionally be calculated and displayed
alongside the node - the current issue is deciding where to display that.  For now we calculate it 
but don't display it.</p>

<p>In future the count could be used to remove the + from a row that doesn't actually have any children.</p>

<p>Optionally the treeView can be populated only when nodes are clicked on.  This will provide callbacks when
nodes are expanded, requesting the additional data.  The node will be set to expanded, and when the data
is added to the grid then it will automatically be displayed by the rowsProcessor.</p>

<p>Treeview adds information to the rows 
- treeLevel - if present and > -1 tells us the level (level 0 is the top level) 
- expandedState = object: pointer to the node in the grid.treeView.rowExpandedStates that refers
  to this row, allowing us to manipulate the state</p>

<p>Since the logic is baked into the rowsProcessors, it should get triggered whenever
row order or filtering or anything like that is changed.  We recall the expanded state
across invocations of the rowsProcessors by putting it into the grid.treeView.rowExpandedStates hash.</p>

<p>By default rows are collapsed, which means all data rows have their visible property
set to false, and only level 0 group rows are set to visible.</p>

<p>We rely on the rowsProcessors to do the actual expanding and collapsing, so we set the flags we want into
grid.treeView.rowExpandedStates, then call refresh.  This is because we can't easily change the visible
row cache without calling the processors, and once we've built the logic into the rowProcessors we may as
well use it all the time.</p>
